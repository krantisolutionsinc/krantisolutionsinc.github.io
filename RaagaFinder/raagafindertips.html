  <u>Raagafinder - Tips and Suggestions</u>
  </center>
  <br>
  <DIV style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; color: white;">
  Raagafinder is a web application that enables users to discover the raaga associated with any song. The user 
  plays a song on the synthesizer that is provided by the application. The application then matches the tune played
  against its database of raagas and recommends a list of raagas that best match the tune. <br><br>

  In order to use Raagafinder, the  user is required to have a basic familiarity with using a Piano or a music 
  synthesizer. To make the usage easier, each key in the synthesizer displays the corresponding swara (note) in 
  the Carnatic system of music. The convention followed by Raagafinder to denote the Swaras is described below: <br><br>
  
  To begin with, there are 12 notes in the Octave. These twelve notes are represented using the 
  7 basic swaras in Carnatic music: 
  <ol>
    <li>Shadjamam denoted by S</li>
    <li>Rishabam. There are three types: 
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Suddha Rishabam denoted by R1</li>
          <li>Chatusruthi Rishabam denoted by R2</li>
          <li>Shatsruthi Rishabam denoted by R3</li>
        </ol>
   </li>
   <li>Gaandharam. There are three types: 
        <ol type="a">
           <li>Suddha Gaandharam denoted by G1</li>
           <li>Saadharana Gaandharam denoted by G2</li>
           <li>Anthara Gaandharam denoted by G3</li>
        </ol>
   </li>
   <li>Madhyamam. There are two types: 
       <ol type="a">
           <li>Suddha Madhyamam denoted by M1</li>
           <li>Prathi Madhyamam denoted by M2</li>
       </ol>
   </li>
   <li>Panchamam denoted by P</li>
   <li>Daivatham. There are three types: 
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Suddha Daivatham denoted by D1</li>
          <li>Chatusruthi Daivatham denoted by D2</li>
          <li>Shatsruthi Daivatham denoted by D3</li>
        </ol>
   </li>         
   <li>Nishaadam. There are three types: 
        <ol type="a">
           <li>Suddha Nishaadam denoted by N1</li>
           <li>Kaisika Nishaadam denoted by N2</li>
           <li>Kaakali Nishaadam denoted by N3</li>
        </ol>
   </li>
  </ol>

  For those who wonder why the above list of swaras equal 16 when there are only 12 notes in an octave. Well, 
  <ul>
    <li>R2 and G1 are the same frequency. </li>
    <li>R3 and G2 are the same frequency. </li>
    <li>D2 and N1 are the same frequency. </li>
    <li>D3 and N2 are the same frequency. </li>
  </ul>
